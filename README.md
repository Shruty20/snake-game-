Welcome to the Snake Game project! This classic game is built using Python and the Turtle graphics library.
The Snake Game is a fun and challenging game where you control a snake to eat food and grow longer while avoiding collisions with walls and your own body.

How to Play

1. **Running the Game**: Start the game by running the `main.py` script.

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2. **Controls**: Use the arrow keys to control the snake's direction:
   - Up: Move the snake upwards
   - Down: Move the snake downwards
   - Left: Move the snake to the left
   - Right: Move the snake to the right

3. **Eating Food**: Guide the snake to the blue food items on the screen. Eating food increases your score and snake's length.

4. **Avoid Collisions**:
   - Colliding with the wall or the snake's own body ends the game.
   - Be strategic and swift to survive and achieve a high score.

5. **Game Over**: When the game ends, a "Game Over" message will be displayed along with your final score.

## Game Features

- **Score Tracking**: The game keeps track of your current score and displays it on the screen.
- **Food Items**: Blue food items appear at random locations for the snake to eat.
- **Length Increase**: The snake's length grows when it eats food.
- **Collision Detection**: The game detects collisions with the wall and the snake's body, resulting in a game over.
- **Highest Score**: Your highest score during the session is recorded.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: The main Python script to run the Snake Game.
- `food.py`: Manages the food objects and their behavior.
- `scoreboard.py`: Handles score tracking and game messages.
- `snake.py`: Defines the Snake class, controlling the snake's actions.
- `screen.py`: Configures the game window using the Screen class.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- The Turtle graphics library is included in the Python standard library.
